NOTE: I'm currently in the middle of updating this page (content and backend). Apologies for any inconsistencies.

I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Center for Biodiversity and Global Change](https://bgc.yale.edu/) at Yale University, working with [Dr. Walter Jetz](https://jetzlab.yale.edu/people/walter-jetz) on global scale models of biodiversity and animal movement.

My current research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to model global-scale patterns of biodiversity and species distributions. I am also interested in birth-death processes for population dynamics, niche modeling with animal movement data, and point-process models for metacommunity analysis. In general, I'm interested in developing models that unify multiple traditional ecological processes.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst where I was advised by [Dr. Dan Sheldon](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sheldon/). My dissertation was on a novel statistical framework for inference algorithms in count-valued distributions, particularly models of population dynamics. The document is available [here](http://kwinner.github.io/files/Winner_dissertation.pdf).

[//]: # On the machine learning side, my primary research interests are in graphical models and probabilistic inference. On the ecological side, my primary research interests are in population ecology and animal movement modeling. I am also actively involved in the growing field of [Computational Sustainability](http://www.compsust.net/), which encompasses many such interdisciplinary research efforts. 

[//]: # My current projects include probabilistic inference for latent variables with countably infinite support (particularly time series of abundance) applied to moth, butterfly and salamander datasets and a continent-scale model of bird migration using Doppler weather radar data.
